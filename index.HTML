<h1>Photography</h1>

<p>What I find captivating about photography is its unique ability to freeze moments in time.
  It lets me capture specific moments, including scenes, stories, and emotions.
  I love that it allows photographers and viewers to connect with the world and its history.
  Photography has so many possibilities, even for people who do not have much experience with taking photos.
  I am constantly drawn to its possibilites and how capture all kinds of moments.

  <p>Two of my favorite photographers are Hörður Kristleifsson and Ansel Adams.
    Hörður Kristleifsson is not as well-known as Ansel Adams, but both are known for their photography skills.
    Ansel is known for his iconic, high contrast black and white photographs of the American West, especially wilderness and national parks in the United States.
    Kristleifsson is known for his vibrant landscape photos of Iceland that have a dreamlike quality.
    While Adams made contributions to landscape photography in the 1900s, Kristleifsson brings a fresh, modern perspective to landscape photoraphy.
